# Understanding /32 in IP Addresses

## 1. IP addresses are binary numbers

An IPv4 address like `83.77.37.140` is really made of **32 bits**:

- `83` → `01010011`
- `77` → `01001101`
- `37` → `00100101`
- `140` → `10001100`

Thus, the full IP is:
```
01010011.01001101.00100101.10001100
```
(32 bits total)

---

## 2. What does `/32` mean?

- `/32` says:
  > "Use all 32 bits to identify the network and the host."

- No bits are left flexible.
- It matches exactly **one** IP address.

If it were `/24`, for example, it would mean:
- First 24 bits define the network.
- Last 8 bits could vary → 256 possible addresses.

## 3. Visual Comparison

| CIDR Notation | Meaning | Example | Number of IPs |
|:--------------|:--------|:--------|:--------------|
| `/32` | One exact address | `83.77.37.140` | 1 |
| `/31` | Two addresses | `83.77.37.140` and `83.77.37.141` | 2 |
| `/30` | Four addresses | `83.77.37.140`–`83.77.37.143` | 4 |
| `/24` | 256 addresses | `83.77.37.0`–`83.77.37.255` | 256 |

---

## 4. Why is `/32` strict?

- A firewall or VPN rule with `/32` means:
  - Only **this exact IP** is allowed.
  - No other IPs nearby will accidentally match.

This is crucial for:
- Securing admin panels.
- Authorising VPNs.
- Whitelisting access from your home.

## 5. Simple Summary

- **/32 = laser-precise focus** on one IP.
- No wildcards, no ranges.
- Ideal when you work with a dynamic IP or when exact security is required.

## 6. Example Firewall Rule (IPv4)

If you want to allow only your current IP `83.77.37.140` (with `/32`) through a firewall:

**Linux UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):**
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 83.77.37.140/32 to any port 22 proto tcp
```
(This would allow SSH access only from your IP.)

**iptables:**
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 83.77.37.140/32 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

**FirewallD (CentOS/Fedora):**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="83.77.37.140/32" port protocol="tcp" port="22" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Cloudflare Access Policy Example:**
```text
IP Access Rule:
Allow 83.77.37.140/32
```

---

## 7. Example Firewall Rule (IPv6)

IPv6 addresses have 128 bits. For a single IPv6 address, you use `/128`.

If your IPv6 address is `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`, your rule would be:

**Linux UFW:**
```bash
sudo ufw allow from 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334/128 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

**iptables (ip6tables for IPv6):**
```bash
sudo ip6tables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334/128 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

**FirewallD:**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv6" source address="2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334/128" port protocol="tcp" port="22" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Cloudflare Access Policy Example (IPv6):**
```text
IP Access Rule:
Allow 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334/128
```
