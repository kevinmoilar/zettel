# Service Design - Business Process Modelling - Automation - Digitisation 

Thinking about how the engineering and organizational development firm I got into is building a massive new energy service for a city while trying to modernize the organization at the same time, I get the feeling were not doing it quite right. I have the lead in the overall process design and visualization, organizing workshops, learning events etc but the information is not as visible and accessible as it should be.

I feel, the key might be in a combination of more structured Service Design, better communication and automation & digitisation. At the same time we must keep it down to earth and not blow up the cost and expectation.

People in the organization need to collaborate and build things, based on collaboratively built processes which they can see from some sort of handbook that I guess cannot be a wiki in the old sence. Can it be based on BPMN? Plus a Web-App? Combined with good visualization / info graphics...? This is to be explored.
