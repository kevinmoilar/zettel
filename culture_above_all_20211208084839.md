# Isn't the right culture and a good search enough?

Thinking about Knowldedge Management and possible tools / methods like OKR, KWL, Scrum I remember just how much time is wasted in writing "items" such as Tasks, User Stories, OKRs that then turn out never to have been worked on or with.

This keeps bringing me back to the culture issue. Yes, iterative, reflective, testing (prototyping) with the customer / end user focus. But if used to cover for a missing culture of trust and the common desire to learn / get better it will be just waste.
