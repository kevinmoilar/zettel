# Dialogue - The Correlation of Necessity and Creativity

Through my long term quest to improve private and professional communication I picked up David Bohm's book on dialogue again. The idea of "necessity" Bohm writes about appears new to me. I find it intriguing; especially to link necessity with creativity. The latter is a topic I contemplate since several years as a source for "better organizations" (see also \cite{@book{amabile1996creativity}).

> What about these notions of necessity which we have to set up or discover? If an artist just puts on his paint in arbitrary places, you would say there wasn't anything to it; if he just follows somebody else's order of necessity, he's mediocre. He's got to create his own order of necessity. Different parts of the form he is making must have an inner necessity or else the thing has not really much of a value. This artistic necessity is creative. The artist has his freedom in this creative act. Therefore, freedom makes possible *a creative perception of new orders of necessity*. I you can't do that, you're not really free. You say you're doing whatever you like and that's your impulse, but I think we've seen that your impulses can come from your thoughts. For example, the thought of what is necessary will make an impulse, and people who are in international conflict will say our impulse is to got to war and get rd of these people who are in our way, as if that were freedom. But it isn't. They're being driven by that thought. So doing what you like is seldom freedom , because what you like is determined by what you think and that is often a pattern which is fixed. Therefore we have a creative necessity which we discover — you can discover individually or we can do so collectively in the group — of how to operate in a group in a new way. Any group which has problems really has got to solve them creatively if they're serious problems. It can't just be b trade-offs an negotiations of the old ways.
> I think this is one of the key points, then — to realize when you come to an assumption, that there is an assumption of absolute necessity which you're getting into, an that's why everything is sticking.
