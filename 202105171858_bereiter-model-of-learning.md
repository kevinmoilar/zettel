# Bereiter quoted in Visible Learning p. 27

"Good teaching involves constructing explanations, criticizing, drawing out inferences, finding appications, and there 'should never be a need or the teacher to think of ways to inject more thinking into the curriculum. That would be like trying to inject more aerobic exercise into the lives of Sherpa porters' (Bereiter, 2002, p. 380)
