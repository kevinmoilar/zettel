# Context is Dynamic

It seems the context should not be stored in Zettel, as it is dynamic: a Zettel is relevant in different contexts depending on the current topic of a discussion / of thinking. So it should be removed from the Zettel template (or dynamically inserted at a later stage). I am creating a Zettel for this, because the implications are not just technical. What relevance to learning does the context in an organisational discussion have?
