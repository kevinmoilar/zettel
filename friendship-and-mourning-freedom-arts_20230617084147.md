# Friendship and Mourning in the New York Avant-Garde 

In chapter 2 "Ã‰lan Vital... and how to fake it" Dohoney writes about how Feldman was possibly influenced by the philosopher Bergson and his influence on the British-born Harvard professor Alfred North Whitehead, who also influenced Feldman. I'm referencing these to read more by those two. What this Zettel is really about, is my interest with human freedom (and the loss of it) - something Bergson (whom I did not know until now) was engaged with, which in turn links to the writing of Erich Fromm and more recently, Byung-Chul Han, Eva Illouz and others.

The issue of humanity, the arts, the loss of freedom and "commercialisation" of people through capitalism in the industrial and post-industrial world.
