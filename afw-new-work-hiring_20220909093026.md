# AFW New Work 

I am reading Martin Koch's Paper on New Work "Corporate Learning"i (p. 26). It triggered a thought regarding the AFW Project I work in and the kind of collaboration we have with our client. What if we supported our client in hiring someone for the role we currently hold, onboarding them as one of ours instead of our client onboarding them? This person could thus bring our new work perspective into the organization â€” quite efficiently I imagine.
